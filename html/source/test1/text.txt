Machines, robots, and androids, 
are not a recent invention: artificial life forms have kindled the imagination of mankind for centuries. 
We already know concepts of robots from earlier times like Greek mythology and literature of past centuries.
Pandora was formed out of clay by Hephaestus; Olimpia is the robot woman whom the protagonist in ETA Hoffmann's "Sandman" falls in love with, and Hadaly was the first fictional artificial life form which was called "Android". 
Meanwhile, several decades (and in some cases even centuries) ago, robots made the leap from fantasy to reality.
In our analysis of the naming of robots though, we do not distinguish between real and fictional machines, 
automata and artificial intelligences. 
We deal with all kinds of names for artificial life forms: robots, machines, and automata, whether they exist, have existed, or whether they are sprung from the realm of legend or the imagination of science fiction writers.
